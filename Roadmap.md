# Dabr v1 #

The existing code at http://dabr.co.uk is approximately version one. I've never really worried about releases or version numbers. The code is still getting updated with bug fixes and minor new features on an ad hoc basis.

This will change with the introduction of "Dabr v2", which is a merge of @dabr, @newdabr, and the SVN branch dabr\_from\_scratch.

# Dabr v2 #

Dabr v2 is the current Dabr code rewritten from scratch and in an unfinished and barely functional state. When it is ready, it will replace the existing Dabr code and the live site at dabr.co.uk

## Planned features ##

  * Clean code with _comments_
  * A backend database to cache tweets and speed up the site
  * Database-driven features such as:
    * Contact grouping
    * Filtering
    * Unread message counts
  * Internationalisation - language files making the project easier to translate
  * Templates - making it easier to customise the design without interfering with code
